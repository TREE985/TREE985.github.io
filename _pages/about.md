My name is Joshua Qu (屈嘉树), I'm a fourth year student from the school of Electrical Engineering, [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm doing research intern at PSU under the guidence of Prof. [Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/). My research interests lie in **multi-modal learning** and **anomaly detection**.  
You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV-Jiashu Qu.pdf)
